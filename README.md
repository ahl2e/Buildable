## Technologies

+ Ruby on rails - A framework for building ruby based web apps using a Postgres Database
+ jQuery Ajax - allows asynchronous calls to the backend database without interfering with the front end experience
+ React - Dynamically generates front-end experience allowing for fluid single-page apps.

## Features

#### Projects
  Share projects you're proud of.  Once you've added the project, add step by step instructions for others to recreate them.
  Each step will soon be able to include pictures to illustrate your technique.

#### Search
  Search the database for projects matching your interest.  Search currently scans the title of a project, but will soon look at descriptions to find even more possibilities.
